#Feature extraction
"""
in python an audio signal is a numpy array

a sound is composed of an amplitude and frequency. sound = vibration
amplitude is essentially how loud the sound is. (amp in music is to apply amplitude transformation to a sound)

frequency is the number of waves in a time period, which corresponds to pitch.
a higher pitch would mean a higher frequency.

Audio signals consists of lots of many features, we will try to attempt to extract them
relevant to the problem we are trying to solve.

1. Zero crossing rate

rate where sound signal crosses zero. +ve to -ve. Used heavily in speech recognition and 
music feature retrieval

what does it mean when a sound signal crosses 0?

2. Central spectroid

indicates where the center of mass is located on a spectrum. perceptively has a connection
with the "brightness" of a sound. Calculated as the weighted mean of frequencies present in the 
signal determined by Fourier transform (what is this), with magnitudes as weights.
x(n) represents the weighted frequency value, or magnitude, of bin number n, and f(n) represents the center frequency of that bin.

e.g for blues an metal, there are generally 2 different center of masses, blues is generally
the same throughout the length of the song, in metal it would be towards the end.

3. Spectral rolloff

measures the shape of the signal. represents the frequency below which a specified % of the 
spectral energy lies e.g 85%

4. Mel-Frequency Cepstral coefficients

(MFCCs) of a signal are a small set of features (usually about 10â€“20) which concisely describe the overall shape of a spectral envelope. It models the characteristics of the human voice.


5. Chroma frequencies

Chroma features are an interesting and powerful representation for music audio in which the entire spectrum is projected onto 12 bins 
representing the 12 distinct semitones (or chroma) of the musical octave.
